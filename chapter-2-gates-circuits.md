# Chapter 2: Quantum Gates & Circuits

*The quantum toolbox for manipulating qubits*

## Introduction

Having established what qubits are and how they differ fundamentally from classical bits, we now turn to the question: how do we compute with them? Classical computers use logic gates (AND, OR, NOT) to manipulate bits and build complex calculations. Quantum computers use **quantum gates** to manipulate qubits while preserving their quantum properties.

This chapter explores the fundamental quantum gates, how they work, and how they combine to form quantum circuits that implement quantum algorithms. We'll see how quantum gates are fundamentally different from classical gates - they're reversible, they can create and manipulate superposition, and they can entangle qubits in ways that have no classical analog.

## Fundamental Principles of Quantum Gates

Before diving into specific gates, we need to understand the principles that govern all quantum operations.

### Unitarity: The Quantum Constraint

All quantum gates (except measurement) must be **unitary operations**. Mathematically, this means the gate is represented by a unitary matrix U, where U†U = I (the dagger † denotes complex conjugate transpose).

**What unitarity means physically:**
- **Reversibility**: Every quantum gate can be undone by applying its inverse
- **Probability preservation**: The total probability remains 1 after the operation
- **Length preservation**: The "distance" between quantum states is preserved

**Why this matters:**
- Information cannot be created or destroyed in quantum operations
- All quantum computations (except measurement) are reversible
- This constraint limits which operations are possible but ensures physical consistency

### Quantum Gates as Rotations

On the Bloch sphere representation of qubits, quantum gates correspond to **rotations**. Every single-qubit gate rotates the qubit state to a new position on the sphere. This geometric interpretation provides intuitive understanding:

- **Pauli gates**: 180° rotations around different axes
- **Hadamard gate**: 180° rotation around the X+Z axis
- **Phase gates**: Rotations around the Z-axis
- **Arbitrary rotations**: Any rotation on the sphere is a valid quantum gate

### Gate Composition and Circuits

Quantum gates can be composed sequentially to create more complex operations. The mathematical representation involves matrix multiplication:

If gates U₁ and U₂ are applied sequentially, the combined operation is U₂U₁ (note the reverse order - rightmost gate applied first).

## The Pauli Gates: Fundamental Single-Qubit Operations

![Quantum gate operations on the Bloch sphere](diagrams/quantum-gates.png)

The **Pauli gates** (X, Y, Z) are the most fundamental single-qubit gates, named after physicist Wolfgang Pauli. They form the building blocks for more complex operations.

### The X Gate (Quantum NOT)

**Matrix representation:**
```
X = [0 1]
    [1 0]
```

**Action:**
- X|0⟩ = |1⟩
- X|1⟩ = |0⟩
- X(α|0⟩ + β|1⟩) = α|1⟩ + β|0⟩

**Bloch sphere interpretation**: 180° rotation around the X-axis

**Classical analog**: The NOT gate - flips 0↔1

**Key properties:**
- **Self-inverse**: XX = I (applying twice returns to original state)
- **Bit-flip**: Changes computational basis states |0⟩↔|1⟩
- **Preserves superposition**: Superposition states remain in superposition

### The Y Gate

**Matrix representation:**
```
Y = [0 -i]
    [i  0]
```

**Action:**
- Y|0⟩ = i|1⟩
- Y|1⟩ = -i|0⟩
- Y(α|0⟩ + β|1⟩) = -iβ|0⟩ + iα|1⟩

**Bloch sphere interpretation**: 180° rotation around the Y-axis

**Effect**: Both bit-flip AND phase-flip - it's like applying X and Z gates simultaneously

**Key properties:**
- **Self-inverse**: YY = I
- **Complex operation**: Introduces imaginary numbers into amplitudes
- **Combined effect**: Equivalent to iXZ up to global phase

### The Z Gate (Phase Flip)

**Matrix representation:**
```
Z = [1  0]
    [0 -1]
```

**Action:**
- Z|0⟩ = |0⟩
- Z|1⟩ = -|1⟩
- Z(α|0⟩ + β|1⟩) = α|0⟩ - β|1⟩

**Bloch sphere interpretation**: 180° rotation around the Z-axis

**Effect**: **Phase flip** - leaves |0⟩ unchanged, adds minus sign to |1⟩

**Key insight**: While classical gates only manipulate probabilities, the Z gate manipulates quantum **phase** - information that has no classical analog but affects quantum interference.

### Understanding Quantum Phase

The Z gate introduces our first encounter with purely quantum behavior: **quantum phase**. Consider these two states:

- State A: (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2
- State B: (|0⟩ - |1⟩)/√2

Classically, these states are identical - both give 50% probability of measuring 0 or 1. But quantum mechanically, they're different states that can be distinguished through quantum interference. The Z gate converts State A to State B.

## The Hadamard Gate: Creating Superposition

The **Hadamard gate** is arguably the most important single-qubit gate in quantum computing. It creates equal superposition states and enables quantum parallelism.

### Mathematical Definition

**Matrix representation:**
```
H = (1/√2)[1  1]
           [1 -1]
```

**Action:**
- H|0⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2 ≡ |+⟩
- H|1⟩ = (|0⟩ - |1⟩)/√2 ≡ |-⟩

### Creating Superposition

Starting with a definite state |0⟩, the Hadamard gate creates an equal superposition:

**Before**: |0⟩ (definitely 0)
**After**: (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2 (50% chance of 0, 50% chance of 1)

This is the quantum equivalent of "flipping a fair coin" - but the qubit remains in superposition until measured.

### The Hadamard Basis

The Hadamard gate defines its own measurement basis:
- **|+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2**: The "plus state"
- **|-⟩ = (|0⟩ - |1⟩)/√2**: The "minus state"

These states are **eigenstates** of the X operator, meaning X|+⟩ = |+⟩ and X|-⟩ = -|-⟩.

### Reversibility and Self-Inverse Property

The Hadamard gate is **self-inverse**: HH = I

This means:
- H(H|0⟩) = H|+⟩ = |0⟩
- H(H|1⟩) = H|-⟩ = |1⟩

**Geometric interpretation**: The Hadamard gate corresponds to a 180° rotation around the axis that bisects the X and Z axes on the Bloch sphere.

### Quantum Parallelism Foundation

When applied to n qubits initially in |0⟩⊗n, n Hadamard gates create:

H⊗n|0⟩⊗n = (1/√2ⁿ)Σ|x⟩

This superposition contains all 2ⁿ possible n-bit strings simultaneously, enabling quantum algorithms to process all possible inputs in parallel.

## Phase Gates: Fine-Grained Control

Beyond the discrete 180° rotations of Pauli gates, we need gates that provide more precise control over quantum phases.

### The S Gate (Phase Gate)

**Matrix representation:**
```
S = [1 0]
    [0 i]
```

**Action:**
- S|0⟩ = |0⟩
- S|1⟩ = i|1⟩

**Effect**: Adds a 90° phase shift to the |1⟩ component

### The T Gate (π/8 Gate)

**Matrix representation:**
```
T = [1    0   ]
    [0 e^(iπ/4)]
```

**Action:**
- T|0⟩ = |0⟩
- T|1⟩ = e^(iπ/4)|1⟩

**Effect**: Adds a 45° phase shift to the |1⟩ component

**Special importance**: The T gate is crucial for achieving **universal quantum computation**. While Hadamard and CNOT gates can create many useful operations, adding the T gate makes the gate set capable of approximating any quantum operation to arbitrary precision.

### Arbitrary Single-Qubit Rotations

The most general single-qubit gates are parametric rotations:

**Rotation around X-axis**: Rx(θ) = cos(θ/2)I - i sin(θ/2)X
**Rotation around Y-axis**: Ry(θ) = cos(θ/2)I - i sin(θ/2)Y  
**Rotation around Z-axis**: Rz(θ) = cos(θ/2)I - i sin(θ/2)Z

These allow continuous control over qubit rotations, essential for implementing arbitrary quantum algorithms.

## Two-Qubit Gates: Creating Entanglement

Single-qubit gates, no matter how sophisticated, cannot create entanglement. For that, we need **two-qubit gates** that allow qubits to interact.

### The CNOT Gate (Controlled-NOT)

The **CNOT gate** is the most fundamental two-qubit gate and the primary tool for creating entanglement.

**Matrix representation** (4×4 for two qubits):
```
CNOT = [1 0 0 0]
       [0 1 0 0]
       [0 0 0 1]
       [0 0 1 0]
```

**Truth table**:
- |00⟩ → |00⟩ (control=0, target unchanged)
- |01⟩ → |01⟩ (control=0, target unchanged)  
- |10⟩ → |11⟩ (control=1, flip target)
- |11⟩ → |10⟩ (control=1, flip target)

**Action**: If the control qubit is |1⟩, apply X gate to target qubit; otherwise do nothing.

### Creating Bell States with CNOT

![Bell state preparation circuit](diagrams/bell-state-circuit.png)

The CNOT gate's true power emerges when combined with superposition:

**Bell state preparation**:
1. Start with |00⟩
2. Apply H to first qubit: (|0⟩ + |1⟩)|0⟩/√2 = (|00⟩ + |10⟩)/√2
3. Apply CNOT: (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2

The result is maximally entangled - measuring the first qubit instantly determines the second qubit's state, regardless of physical separation.

### Properties of CNOT

**Reversibility**: CNOT is self-inverse (CNOT·CNOT = I)
**Asymmetry**: Control and target qubits play different roles
**Entangling**: Can create entanglement from product states
**Classical behavior**: On computational basis states, behaves like classical controlled-NOT

### Other Important Two-Qubit Gates

**Controlled-Z (CZ)**: Applies Z gate to target if control is |1⟩
- Symmetric unlike CNOT (control and target are interchangeable)
- Matrix: diag(1, 1, 1, -1)

**Controlled Phase (CPhase)**: Adds phase φ to |11⟩ state only
- Generalizes CZ gate to arbitrary phases
- Crucial for many quantum algorithms

**SWAP Gate**: Exchanges the states of two qubits
- SWAP|ab⟩ = |ba⟩
- Can be constructed from three CNOT gates

## Universal Gate Sets

A **universal gate set** is a finite collection of gates that can approximate any quantum operation to arbitrary precision. This is quantum computing's equivalent to classical computing's universal gate sets (like NAND gates).

### Common Universal Sets

**{H, T, CNOT}**: The most theoretically important universal set
- **H**: Creates superposition
- **T**: Provides necessary phase control
- **CNOT**: Creates entanglement

**{Ry(θ), CNOT}**: Popular in practice
- **Ry(θ)**: Arbitrary single-qubit rotations (parameterized)
- **CNOT**: Two-qubit entangling gate

**{All single-qubit gates, CNOT}**: Conceptually simple
- Any single-qubit operation + entangling two-qubit gate

### Why T Gate is Special

The T gate deserves special attention because:

**Transcendental**: Its matrix elements involve e^(iπ/4), an irrational number
**Non-Clifford**: Unlike H and CNOT, T is not in the Clifford group
**Magic**: Provides the "magic" needed to go beyond classical simulation
**Fault-tolerance challenge**: Extremely difficult to implement fault-tolerantly

### Gate Compilation

Real quantum algorithms must be **compiled** from abstract operations into sequences of gates from the universal set. This process involves:

1. **Decomposition**: Breaking complex operations into simple gates
2. **Approximation**: Using finite sequences to approximate arbitrary rotations  
3. **Optimization**: Minimizing gate count and circuit depth
4. **Hardware mapping**: Adapting to specific qubit connectivity constraints

## Quantum Circuits: The Assembly Language

Quantum circuits provide a visual and mathematical framework for describing quantum computations.

### Circuit Notation

**Horizontal lines**: Represent individual qubits (time flows left to right)
**Boxes**: Single-qubit gates
**Connected symbols**: Multi-qubit gates (CNOT shown as ⊕ with control line)
**Measurement**: Meter symbols
**Classical bits**: Double lines (for storing measurement results)

### Example: Bell State Circuit

```
|0⟩ ——[H]——●——[📊]—— classical bit 0
             │
|0⟩ ————————⊕——[📊]—— classical bit 1
```

This circuit:
1. Applies Hadamard to first qubit
2. Uses first qubit to control NOT on second qubit
3. Measures both qubits

### Circuit Properties

**Acyclicity**: No feedback loops (quantum circuits are directed acyclic graphs)
**Parallelism**: Gates on different qubits can execute simultaneously
**Depth**: Maximum number of sequential gates (critical for decoherence)
**Width**: Number of qubits required

### Circuit Equivalence

Many different circuits can implement the same quantum operation:

**Gate identities**: H·X·H = Z (Hadamard conjugates X into Z)
**Commutation**: Gates on different qubits commute
**Cancellation**: Gate followed by inverse cancels out

Circuit optimization uses these equivalences to minimize resource requirements.

## Advanced Gate Concepts

### Controlled Operations

Any single-qubit gate can be made into a controlled operation:
- **Controlled-U**: Applies gate U to target if control is |1⟩
- **Multiple controls**: Toffoli gate (CCNOT) has two control qubits
- **Arbitrary controls**: Can condition on |0⟩ or |1⟩ states

### Parametric Gates

Many quantum gates accept continuous parameters:
- **Rotation gates**: Rx(θ), Ry(θ), Rz(θ)  
- **Phase gates**: Rϕ(φ) = diag(1, e^(iφ))
- **Applications**: Variational quantum algorithms, analog quantum simulation

### Gate Fidelity and Errors

Real quantum gates are imperfect:
- **Coherent errors**: Systematic rotation errors
- **Incoherent errors**: Random noise (decoherence)
- **Gate fidelity**: Measure of how close actual gate is to ideal
- **Error models**: Depolarizing, amplitude damping, dephasing

## Quantum vs Classical Gates

### Fundamental Differences

| Property | Classical Gates | Quantum Gates |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Reversibility** | Often irreversible | Always reversible |
| **Information** | Discrete (0 or 1) | Continuous (amplitudes) |
| **Copying** | Can copy states | No-cloning theorem |
| **Measurement** | Non-destructive | Destructive |
| **Parallelism** | Sequential processing | Quantum parallelism |

### Computational Implications

**Classical**: Computation is a sequence of irreversible logical operations
**Quantum**: Computation is a sequence of reversible unitary transformations followed by measurement

This difference enables quantum algorithms to explore multiple solution paths simultaneously and use interference to amplify correct answers.

## Chapter Summary
